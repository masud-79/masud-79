## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 I am a final year Computer Science Engineering undergraduate with a strong understanding of
 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). I am skilled in web development technologies, including HTML,
 CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and the MERN stack. While I am a beginner in blockchain technology, I
 am highly interested in both blockchain and machine learning. I am passionate about continuously learning
 new concepts and technologies to enhance my knowledge and skills.
